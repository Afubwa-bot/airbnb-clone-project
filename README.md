##  Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern full-stack architecture using robust and scalable technologies. Each component plays a specific role in delivering functionality, performance, and maintainability.

### Backend

- **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build secure and maintainable web applications. In this project, Django powers the RESTful API and handles business logic, user authentication, and routing.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
  An extension of Django for building flexible and powerful APIs. DRF enables easy serialization, viewsets, and API authentication mechanisms for the frontend to consume.

###  Database

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A powerful open-source relational database system. It stores user profiles, listings, bookings, reviews, and payment records. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and SQL standards compliance.

###  API Layer

- **GraphQL** (optional / advanced layer)  
  A modern query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly what they need. If implemented, it would offer an alternative to REST and enable efficient data retrieval.

###  Frontend

- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
  Fundamental technologies for building structured content and styling. These define the layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness of the UI.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
  Enables interactivity in the user interface, including dynamic content updates, form validation, modals, and more.

- **React.js** (optional)  
  A JavaScript library for building fast, responsive, and component-based UIs. React simplifies frontend development by managing UI state and rendering efficiently.

###  Testing

- **PyTest / Django Test Framework**  
  Ensures backend logic is robust and bug-free through unit and integration tests.

- **Postman**  
  Used to manually test and document REST/GraphQL endpoints during development.

###  Deployment & DevOps

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control and collaboration tools to track changes, manage branches, and host the codebase.

- **Docker** (optional)  
  Containers for bundling and deploying the application in isolated, reproducible environments.

- **Heroku / AWS**  
  Platforms for deploying the web app, making it accessible via a public URL with backend and database connectivity.

##  Database Design

The AirBnB Clone will use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to manage structured data across users, listings, bookings, payments, and feedback. Below are the core entities and their relationships.

---

### Users
Represents individuals using the platform — both hosts and guests.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (e.g., host, guest)
- `created_at`

**Relationships:**
- One user **can own multiple properties**
- One user **can make multiple bookings**
- One user **can write multiple reviews**

---

### Properties
Represents homes/apartments listed on the platform.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

**Relationships:**
- A property **belongs to one user (host)**
- A property **can have many bookings**
- A property **can have many reviews**

---

### Bookings
Represents reservation details made by guests.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

**Relationships:**
- A booking **belongs to one user (guest)**
- A booking **belongs to one property**
- A booking **can have one payment**

---

### Payments
Handles transaction information for a booking.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
- `amount`
- `status` (e.g., pending, completed, failed)
- `payment_method`
- `timestamp`

**Relationships:**
- A payment **belongs to one booking**

---

### Reviews
Feedback submitted by guests after their stay.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
- `rating` (e.g., 1–5)
- `comment`
- `created_at`

**Relationships:**
- A review **belongs to one user (guest)**
- A review **belongs to one property**

---

### Entity Relationships Summary
- A **User** ⟶ has many **Properties**
- A **User** ⟶ has many **Bookings**
- A **User** ⟶ has many **Reviews**
- A **Property** ⟶ has many **Bookings**
- A **Property** ⟶ has many **Reviews**
- A **Booking** ⟶ has one **Payment**
